In [previous](http://shudarshon.com/2018-02-24/Jenkins-1.html) post, I have discussed on setting up Jenkins and Jenkins user SSH key configuration. In this post I will discuss on setting up tomcat in application server and integrating app server with jenkins slave. Also we will choose a java sample app that is going to be part of CI/CD process. Check this [post](http://shudarshon.com/2018-03-04/Tomcat-Ansible.html) to install tomcat in app server.

# Need

1. App server (Linux Server where application will run)
2. SSH access to app server
3. Jenkins user ssh public key of Jenkins Slave machine

# Allow Jenkins Slave to SSH into App Server

To automate deployment process from jenkins slave to app server we must allow SSH from jenkins slave to app server. At first gather jenkins user ssh public key from jenkins slave machine as just we did in previous post,

```shell
ubuntu@jenkins-slave:~$ sudo su - jenkins
jenkins@jenkins-slave:~$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
jenkins@jenkins-slave:~$ exit
ubuntu@jenkins-slave:~$ exit
```

Then use that key in the app server as following,

```shell
ubuntu@app-server:~$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh
ubuntu@app-server:~$ vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
ubuntu@app-server:~$ exit
```

Next, test the SSH connection from jenkins slave to app server

```shell
ubuntu@jenkins-slave:~$ sudo su - jenkins
jenkins@jenkins-slave:~$ ssh ubuntu@APP_SERVER_IP
```
If login is successful then proceed to next task.
