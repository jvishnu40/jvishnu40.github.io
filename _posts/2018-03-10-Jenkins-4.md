In [previous](http://shudarshon.com/2018-03-04/Jenkins-3.html) post, I have discussed on running target app in local machine and setting up Jenkins slave SSH key in GitHub. In this post I will discuss on creating Jenkins pipeline and GitHub webhook to automate the CI/CD process.

# Need

1. Jenkins Master SSH access to Jenkins Slave
2. Jenkins Slave SSH access to Application repository in GitHub
3. Jenkins Slave SSH access to app server
4. Git SSH Clone url for application repository in GitHub
5. Jenkins Slave SSH key ID from Jenkins Credentials

# Create GitHub Webhook for Jenkins

Login to Github and click on the appropriate GitHub app repository. Click on the settings and provide account password if asked. Then follow the screenshots,

![Add GitHub Webhook](/assets/img/2018-03-10-1.png)*GitHub Webhook Settings*

![Add GitHub Webhook](/assets/img/2018-03-10-2.png)*Add Jenkins Server URL with github webhook directory name in the URL*

If appropriate URL is provided then there will be green mark beside the URL. Adding this webhook means that if any git push operation is successfully retrieved by GitHub on this specific application repository then it will trigger jenkins build job.

# Create Jenkins Pipeline to perform continuous integration

Login to Jenkins with appropriate username and password. Then follow the screenshots to add pipeline job and script,  

![Create Jenkins Build Item](/assets/img/2018-03-10-3.png)*Create New Item from Jenkins Dashboard*

![Create Jenkins Pipeline](/assets/img/2018-03-10-4.png)*Choose pipleline option and create Jhipster App pipeline*

![Create Jenkins Build Item](/assets/img/2018-03-10-5.png)*Allow Jenkins to Build from GitHub webhook*

![Add pipeline script](/assets/img/2018-03-10-6.png)*Allow Jenkins to run pipleline script*

The pipeline script is available below,

```
node {
  stage('prepare'){
    git(
      url: 'git@github.com:shudarshon/jhipster-sample-app.git',
      credentialsId: '94bfdbec-1bca-4643-89e1-65591d9488bf',
      branch: 'master'
    )
  }
   stage('Build') {
      sh './mvnw -Pprod clean package -DskipTests'
   }
}

```

Now build the project from jenkins dashboard and check the console output. It should return a successful build message.
